## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -n auto -q
```

Tests run via pytest (with xdist for parallel execution). `FakeRunner` and `OrchestratorTests` base class are defined in `tests/helpers.py` and shared across all scheduler test modules. Target individual modules with:

```bash
# Scheduler tests
uv run pytest tests/test_scheduler_core.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_scheduler_execution.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_scheduler_finalize.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_scheduler_followups.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_scheduler_beads.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_tui_state.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_tui_tree.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_tui_render.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_tui_actions.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_tui_app.py -v

# CLI tests (one file per command group)
uv run pytest tests/test_cli_bead.py -v

```

## Agent Guardrails

Guardrail templates live in `templates/agents/` and are mandatory — a missing template fails the bead with `FileNotFoundError`. The built-in set:

- `planner.md`, `developer.md`, `tester.md`, `documentation.md`, `review.md`

At runtime, `build_worker_prompt()` injects an `Agent guardrails:` section and appends the serialized bead context. The applied template is stored under `metadata.guardrails` and `execution_history` for audit.

Only the most recent 5 `execution_history` entries are included in the prompt payload to keep prompt size bounded. The full history remains in bead storage and is unaffected.

### Template Placeholders

Bundled guardrail templates may contain `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens that are substituted with project-specific values during `takt init`:

| Placeholder | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{LANGUAGE}}` | `answers.language` | `Python`, `TypeScript/Node.js` |
| `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` | `answers.test_command` | `pytest`, `npm test` |
| `{{BUILD_CHECK_COMMAND}}` | `answers.build_check_command` | `tsc --noEmit`, `go build ./...` |

Substitution is performed by `onboarding.substitute_template_placeholders()`. The `takt init` command calls `onboarding.install_templates_with_substitution()`, which reads each bundled template, substitutes all recognised tokens, and writes the result to `templates/agents/`. Placeholders that appear in raw bundled templates are replaced in the installed copies — unrecognised `{{...}}` tokens are left as-is.

## Verdict-First Review and Test Results

Review and tester beads produce structured verdict fields:

- `verdict`: `approved` or `needs_changes`
- `findings_count`: number of unresolved findings
- `requires_followup`: explicit follow-up signal

The scheduler treats `verdict` as the control-flow source of truth:
- `approved` completes the bead regardless of narrative `remaining` text
- `needs_changes` blocks the bead and requires a `block_reason`

## Bead Priority

Beads support a `priority` field that controls scheduling order within the set of already-eligible beads.

**Supported values:** `high` and `normal` (the default). `normal` is represented as `None` internally and displays as an empty cell in `takt bead list --plain`.

**Setting priority at creation:**

```bash
takt bead create --agent developer --title "Urgent fix" --description "..." --priority high
```

**Changing priority after creation:**

```bash
takt bead set-priority <bead_id> high    # elevate to high
takt bead set-priority <bead_id> normal  # revert to default
```

**Scheduler behaviour:** At each cycle, `ready` beads are sorted so that `high`-priority beads are dispatched before `normal`-priority beads. Priority controls *ordering only*:
- It does **not** bypass dependency resolution — a high-priority bead still waits for its dependencies to reach `done`.
- It does **not** promote sibling or related beads — only the bead itself is elevated.
- It does **not** override file-scope conflict deferral — a high-priority bead conflicting with an in-progress bead is still deferred.

**Viewing priority:** The `PRIORITY` column appears in `takt bead list --plain`. Beads with `normal` priority display as empty in that column.

## Conflict-Aware Scope

Beads declare `expected_files` and `expected_globs` at creation. The scheduler checks for overlap between in-progress beads and defers conflicting ones. Active file claims are visible via `takt bead claims`.

## Configuration

Settings live in `.takt/config.yaml`. See `src/agent_takt/config.py` for the full schema. Key sections: `common` (scheduler), `codex`, `claude` (per-backend binary, flags, tools, models, timeouts).

## Multi-Backend Support

Two runner backends: `codex` and `claude`. Select via `--runner`, `$AGENT_TAKT_RUNNER`, or `config.default_runner`. `$ORCHESTRATOR_RUNNER` is accepted as a legacy fallback.

See [multi-backend-agents.md](multi-backend-agents.md) for full details.

## Bead Auto-Commit

`RepositoryStorage` automatically commits every bead write and deletion through the storage chokepoint. No manual `git add`/`git commit` is required for bead metadata.

- **Write**: After each `_write_bead()` call, `_git_commit_bead()` stages and commits the bead JSON file. The commit message is `[bead] <id>: created (<agent_type>)` for new beads and `[bead] <id>: <status>` for updates.
- **Deletion**: After `delete_bead()` removes the file, `_git_commit_bead_deletion()` commits the removal with message `[bead] <id>: deleted`.

Both methods are best-effort: git failures are caught and silently ignored so storage operations remain non-fatal when git is unavailable (e.g., detached HEAD, no repo). Concurrent writes are serialized via a class-level `threading.Lock`.

The auto-commit behavior keeps the feature branch in a clean state with respect to bead metadata, which is important for the merge preflight — the rebase step compares against `main` and will not encounter unstaged bead changes.

## CI / Release Automation

The project uses a single GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that triggers on every push to `main`. It runs three sequential jobs:

1. **Test** — installs dependencies with `uv` and runs the full test suite (`uv run pytest tests/ -n auto -q`). All downstream jobs are gated on this passing.

2. **Build** — after tests pass, CI automatically bumps the **patch** component of the version in `pyproject.toml` (via `uv version --bump patch`), commits the change back to `main` with the message `chore: bump version to <version> [skip ci]`, then builds the package with `uv build`.

3. **Publish** — downloads the built distribution and creates a GitHub release tagged `v<version>` with auto-generated release notes, attaching all files from `dist/`.

### Version management

CI only ever increments the patch version. If you need to bump the major or minor version, do so locally before pushing:

```bash
uv version --bump minor   # or major
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: bump minor version to X.Y.0"
git push
```

CI will then apply its patch bump on top of your bump.

### Secrets

No manual secret configuration is required. The workflow uses the repository's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for both committing the version bump and creating the GitHub release.

## Telemetry

Two-tier storage per bead execution:
1. Lightweight metrics in `bead.metadata["telemetry"]` and `telemetry_history`
2. Full prompt/response artifact at `.takt/telemetry/<bead_id>/<attempt>.json`

See [scheduler-telemetry.md](scheduler-telemetry.md) for the full schema.
